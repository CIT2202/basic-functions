# Functions

* Term 2 is all about how we structure and organise the code in our web applications. 
* The key to being able to do this is understanding functions.
* This week's practical is all about the basic concepts surrounding functions in PHP. Next week will use functions to structure and organise the code in a simple CRUD example.

## Completing the practical work
* From github click on notes.md (don't open the downloaded version). These are notes on PHP functions. You should be familiar with the idea of functions from previous programming experience. These notes provide a recap and some specifics on PHP functions. 
* Download this repository, open functions.php in a text editor, and add your own code to answer the questions.

## Learning more
Understanding PHP functions is really important for the term 2 work. If you want some more practice or different/further explanations the Lynda.com videos are very good. Have a search for *PHP Essential Training by Kevin Skoglund, 6. User-Defined Functions*. If you aren't sure how to access Lynda.com please ask in the library or in one of your seminar/practical sessions.
