# Functions

* Term 2 is all about how we structure and organise the code in our web applications.
* The key to being able to do this is understanding functions.
* This week's seminar is all about the basic concepts surrounding functions in PHP. Next the coming weeks will use functions to structure and organise the code in a simple CRUD example.

## Completing the practical work
* From github click on notes.md (don't open the downloaded version). These are notes on PHP functions. You should be familiar with the idea of functions from previous programming experience. These notes provide a recap and some specifics on PHP functions.
* Download this repository, open functions.php in a text editor, and add your own code to answer the questions.
