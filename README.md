* One way to do this is to use functions.
* Before using functions in a database driven web application to write maintainable code you need be familiar with how functions work in PHP. 

## Completing the practical work
* Download this repository, open functions.php in a text editor, and add your own code to answer the questions.
* Use the [notes](https://github.com/CIT2202/basic-functions/blob/master/notes.md) to help you answer the questions.
